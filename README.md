# rgmartin-2--Subreddit-posts-classifier
Sub reddit posts classifier through multiple algorithms for text processing. 

## Abstract
In this project, different Machine Learning Classifiers have been implemented to process text from Reddit
and classify each post of the data. Two different Naive Bayes algorithms have been implemented from
scratch. In addition, several SciKit-Learn based Machine Learning algorithms have also been used. All
these implementations have been compared in terms of accuracy and running time by changing the principal
hyperparameters of each one. It is concluded that the best algorithm is Logistic Regression for the given
data.
